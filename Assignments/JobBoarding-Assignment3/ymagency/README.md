# YM Job Agency

Welcome to the Job Board Application, a web platform designed to streamline the process of managing job listings and tracking applicants. Administrators can effortlessly add, view, and delete job listings and access a comprehensive list of applicants. 
### User Table:
The user table, an extension of Laravel's default user authentication system, includes additional fields to enhance user profiles. These fields include:
- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Phone**
- **Profile Image**
- **Resume Link**
- **Password**

### Jobs Table:
The jobs table, named `fieldjob`, stores essential information about job listings. Each job entry includes details such as:
- **Title**
- **Description**
- **Company**
- **Location**
- **Salary**

Administrators have full control over job management, with the ability to add, update, and delete job listings. Users, on the other hand, can view these job listings to explore available opportunities.

## Pending Task:

I would like to work on a feature where users can apply for jobs and check their status. For that, I would need to create a table that can relate between jobs and users tables.
