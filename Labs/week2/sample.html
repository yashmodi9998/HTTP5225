    <h1>PHP and Creating Output</h1>
  
    <p>The PHP echo command can be used to create output.</p>

    <p>When creating output using echo and PHP, quotes can often cause problems. There are several solutions to using quotes within an echo statement:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Use HTML special characters</li>
        <li>Alternate between single and double quotes</li>
        <li>Use a backslash to escape quotes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>More HTML to Convert</h2>

    <p>PHP says "Hello World!"</p>

    <p>Can you display a sentence with ' and "?</p>
